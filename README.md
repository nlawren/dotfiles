# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles (primarily ubuntu and debian linux specific)

These dotfiles are located in a seperate directory (~/.dotfiles) and symlinked to the correct location.

Useful github information on dotfiles: http://dotfiles.github.io/

To do:

* Looking at whether to use a "move in" or similar type of script. Or just manual.
* also need to investigate using a checksum/versioning idea - perhaps with a python script for checking.
* Updated - use Ansible and apply dotfiles from a repository. Use the stat and potentially MD5 modules to check versions.
* Use Ansible from a central repo.
* Look into using Aqua: https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/
