# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles (for Debian and Ubuntu)

These dotfiles are located in a seperate directory (~/.dotfiles) and symlinked to the correct location.

Useful github information on dotfiles: http://dotfiles.github.io/

To do:

* Building a move in/update script.
* Updated - use Ansible and apply dotfiles from a central repository. Use the stat and potentially sha256 modules to check versions.
* Look into using Aqua: https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/
